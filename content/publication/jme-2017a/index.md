abstract = "We quantify the role of contractionary monetary shocks and nominal wage rigidities in the U.S. Great Contraction. In contrast to conventional wisdom, we find little increase in the economy-wide real wage over 1929-33, although real wages rose significantly in some industries. In the context of a two-sector model with intermediates and nominal wage rigidities in one sector, contractionary monetary shocks account for only a third of the fall in GDP. Intermediate linkages play an important role, as the output decline without intermediates is almost a third larger at the trough. The role of nominal wage rigidities beyond their interaction with monetary shocks is limited."
