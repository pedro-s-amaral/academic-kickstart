We develop a dynamic model where the effects of changes in the costs and benefits of security creation activities can be characterized. Reduced tranching costs and increases in foreign appetite for safe assets can both create large increases in the volume of costly security creation with positive effects on GDP and wages, but they have otherwise very different macroeconomic implications. Reductions in tranching costs counterfactually cause yields to rise, implying that household welfare rises significantly more than output. In contrast, increased foreign demand for safe assets brings yields down and also causes the rents associated with cash-fow transformation to increase. These two features as well as several other subsidiary implications of increased foreign demand in our model, are consistent with recent U.S. data.","tags":null,"title":"Cash-flow Tranching and the Macroeconomy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro S.

In contrast to conventional wisdom, we find little increase in the economy-wide real wage over 1929-33, although real wages rose significantly in some industries. In the context of a two-sector model with intermediates and nominal wage rigidities in one sector, contractionary monetary shocks account for only a third of the fall in GDP. Intermediate linkages play an important role, as the output decline without intermediates is almost a third larger at the trough. The role of nominal wage rigidities beyond their interaction with monetary shocks is limited.","tags":null,"title":"Monetary Shocks and Sticky Wages in the U.S. Great Contraction: A Multi-Sector Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro S.

To illustrate this, we show that the solution proposed in Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008) is rather fragile and fails for some countries in our sample.

We replicate the methodology of this study with an updated and longer sample and find a much smaller impact.

This paper describes a model where, in equilibrium, the characteristics of formal and informal workers differ systematically, even though labor markets are perfectly competitive. The informal sector emphasizes low-skill work, as in the data, because informal managers have access to less outside financing, and choose to substitute low-skill labor for physical capital.","tags":[],"title":"A Competitive Model of the Informal Sector","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro S.
